# Dotfiles
Want to make the vim text editor even better? Use a [.vimrc](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Open_vimrc_file) file! You are in the right place ;-)

## Setup
Clone the repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aruniverse/dotfiles.git
```

Navigate into the directory.
```sh
cd dotfiles/
```

Create an executable file.
```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
```

Run the set up script. The .vimrc file will be in your $HOME directory.
```sh
./setup.sh
```
